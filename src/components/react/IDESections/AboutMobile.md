    <h1>
        Hi!ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yeferson Ruzon,
        Web front-end developer &
        UI/UX Designer.
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate UI/UX
        Designer & Web Front-End
        Developer of 21 years old.
        My focus is on creating
        digital experiences that
        are not only visually
        appealing but also intuitive
        and functional. I combine my
        UI/UX design skills with
        a strong background in
        front-end development to
        build user interfaces that
        trul resonate with users. My
        journey has equipped me
        with a unique blend of design
        thinking and technical
        proficiency, enabling me to
        bridge the gap between
        aesthetics and functionality.
        Whether it's crafting 
        pixel-perfect designs 
        or writing clean, efficient 
        code, I am committed to
        creating digital products that 
        leave a lasting impact.
